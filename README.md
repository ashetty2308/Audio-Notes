**Overview**
One of my favorite hobbies is to go on walks and explore new areas around me. While extremely fun, it does take some time away from school + studying. Consequently, I thought it would be useful to build a tool that can transcribe my notes into a real-time audio narration. 

**Currently**
Work in progress! Currently developing the core functionality. Tech stack includes Go, AWS S3, ElevenLabs, Web Socket Programming as of now. Will probably include some frontend down the line, and some orchestration & deployment services.
