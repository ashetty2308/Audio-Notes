**Overview**
- One of my favorite hobbies is to go on walks and explore new areas around me. While extremely fun, it does take some time away from school + studying. Consequently, I thought it would be useful to build a tool that can transcribe my notes into a real-time audio narration so that I can review material while voyaging.

**Currently**
- Work in progress! Currently developing the core functionality. 
- Tech stack includes: Go, Python, AWS S3, gRPC, ElevenLabs, Web Socket Programming.
- Future iterations will probably lead to frontend dev and orchestration/deployment tools as well.
